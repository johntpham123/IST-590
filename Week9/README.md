Only the first 3 hops are the same 
Codepath has 12 hops compared to google with 7

Telnet
One thing that makes telnet insecure is that it send packets in plaintext, which could be easily intercepted by a hacker sniffing the network

Curl and Wget
Wget lets you download files from http/https and ftp servers and builds the request automatically
curl allows you to build the request as you wish and supports more protocols compared to wget
wget supports recursive downloading
curl is more likely to be found on a Linux OS
Syntax for downloading a file "curl -0 [url]

SSH and SCP
Key authentication is harder to crack and stored on your computer. It also doesn't have to be rememberd by the user
Passwords on the other hand, are easy to forget and crack
scp /path/to/source-file user@host:/path/to/destination-folder/

225 requests and most of the content were javacripts and png images

security.codepath.com tcpdump

There are less packets dumped. The difference is that there aren't as many things loaded onto the securit codepath pages as the codepath website

Milestone 4
For this milestone I was not able to access the admin console. 
Whenever I would try to install the MHN admin application using the sudo ./install.sh command this would pop up

I typed in the same username and password I created but it would not let me have access. I've also tried redoing everything on a new computer with a new email and it would prompt the exact same result. It never asked me to choose a new email or password like they're suppose to in milestone 2 but instead asked me to log in right away.

Because of this I was not able to do milestone 5
