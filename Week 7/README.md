    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: https://gph.is/2Gf2eF0

2. Filesystem Credentials Dialog CSRF

    - Vulnerability types: CSRF
    - Tested in version:4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.15
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: https://gph.is/2L2LCE3
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: I first deleted the original login button on wordpress.

Information that are being inputted into that website are then captured by burp and the attacker can use those captured credentials to login.
